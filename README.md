### Branching strategy
We are following **GitFlow** as the branching strategy and for release management.

The central repo holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

- master
- develop

The `master` branch at origin should be familiar to every Git user. Parallel to the `master` branch, another branch exists called `develop`.

We consider `origin/master` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a *production-ready* state.

We consider `origin/develop` to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

#### Supporting branches
Next to the main branches `master` and `develop`, our development model uses a variety of supporting branches to aid parallel development between team members.

The different types of branches we may use are:

- Feature branches
- Release branches
- Hotfix branches

### Contributing
Fork the repository. Then, run:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:<username>/gitflow.git
cd kandy-cpaas2-sample-android
git branch master origin/master
git flow init -d
git checkout develop
git flow feature start <your feature>
```

Then, do work and commit your changes. When your `feature` is completed, raise the pull-request against `develop`.
